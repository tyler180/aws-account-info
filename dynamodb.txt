DynamoDB Schema Design
Given the requirement, we aim for a schema that supports efficient querying of accounts and their services. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database, and its design encourages thinking in terms of access patterns.

Table Structure
Table Name: AWSAccounts
Primary Key: Composite of Partition Key and Sort Key
Attributes:

AccountID (Partition Key): A unique identifier for each AWS account.
EntityType (Sort Key): To distinguish between an account and its services. It can be AccountInfo for the account's details or Service#{ServiceName} for services associated with the account.
AccountName: Name of the AWS account.
ServiceName: Name of the AWS service (e.g., EC2, S3). This is relevant only for items where EntityType starts with Service#.
ServiceDetails: A map containing the service details. This structure can vary based on the service.
Example Items
Account Information:

AccountID: "123456789012"
EntityType: "AccountInfo"
AccountName: "MyAWSAccount"
Service Information (EC2 for the same account):

AccountID: "123456789012"
EntityType: "Service#EC2"
ServiceName: "EC2"
ServiceDetails: { "Region": "us-east-1", "InstanceCount": 10 }
This design supports multiple AWS services under a single account by leveraging the EntityType sort key for querying both account details and its associated services efficiently.
